##### an open-source programming language

### I am .....

I'll be in variety platform (JS, JVM, etc...)

I love OOP and FP.

I like both [t]ype-class and #method

**And I hate COMMA(,)**

## Feature

### folding function

optimize function call with 'folding' keyword.

They can be pre-carculated with pure objects on compiling.

#### example

When we have the 'folding' function...

``` folding square (a Int) = a*a ```

and code such as...

``` println(square(4)) ```

``` println(4+4+4+4) ```

``` println(16) ```

Then these code are all the same as this...

``` println(16) ```

(operaters such as [+],[*],[-],[/] are also 'folding' function )
