I love variety platform (JS, JVM, etc...)

I love both OOP and FP.

I like both [t]ype-class and #method

optimize function call with 'folding' keyword.

They can be pre-carculated with pure objects on compiling.

<summary> #### example </summary>

When we have the 'folding' function...

``` folding square (a Int) = a*a ```

and code such as...

``` println(square(4)) ```

``` println(4+4+4+4) ```

``` println(16) ```

Then these code are all the same as this...

``` println(16) ```

(operaters such as [+],[*],[-],[/] are also 'folding' function )
